# Sticky-Notes

### Description

The Sticky Notes feature is a convenient way to jot down notes quickly. 
By using React JavaScript, we can create a custom widget that integrates with the Mendix platform, allowing us to create and manage our own notes without relying on external tools. 
I accomplish this by utilizing the libraries of React, React DOM, and UUID, along with the React hooks of useState and useReducer. This widget enables us to easily capture our thoughts and ideas on the fly.

### Dependencies 

â€¢	Studio pro version 9.20.0

### Configuration

To get started with Sticky Notes, a Mendix widget, first download it from the Mendix Marketplace. Then, simply drag and drop the widget onto your desired page within your Mendix project. Double-click on the widget to open its configuration, and under the General tab, enter your Entity name using the format "YourModuleName.EntityName" as shown in the accompanying image. Finally, enter your Attribute Name in the appropriate field..
You're all set! You can now use the Sticky Notes Widget within your application.
